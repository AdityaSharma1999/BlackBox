The objective of BlackBox is to deduce the location of multiple objects (referred to henceforth
as “balls”). The player projects a line from a valid location on the edge of the grid, referred to as
an entry port. This line interacts with the balls on the game board based on a set of rules
(defined below). Using their knowledge of these interactions, the player’s goal is to accurately
guess the location of these balls using as few projections as possible.
